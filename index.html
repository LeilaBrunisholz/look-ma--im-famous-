                <h6 class="card-title">Lincoln was born into poverty. He was born in a log cabin in Kentucky which he and his family lived in. Being born in poverty made him different from most other presidents since they were usually born into wealthy or influential families. Later, Lincoln's family moved to Indiana and then Lincoln worked at a store where he earned the name “honest abe”. He earned his nickname because the customer overpaid by a little bit, but Lincoln went out of his way when the store closed to give the customer back the change. Later, Lincoln joined the army, became a lawyer, got married, and had a family. This is when he started becoming involved in law and politics.

He dealt with armies, the economy, leading the war and while all of that was happening, he had to make sure other nations didn’t get involved (emancipation proclamation).
